## Notes to self
## Remember how to push to github
1. Use `git status` to see files that haven't been committed yet
2. Use `git add .` to add all file changes, or `git add FILENAME` to save a specific file
3. Use `git commit -m MESSAGE` to commit the changes to the branch with a message explaining what the changes are
4. Use `git push` to push the changes to remote github
5. Check at `https://joshuakasyoka.github.io/joshuakasyoka/index.html` after a few mins to see if changes have gone through

                            <p>Doing my degree in English literature, the words ‘technology is pretty cool isn’t it?’ or ‘tech is exciting!’ were rarely, if ever, mentioned. No doubt, this is due to a reputation in the humanities and elsewhere, that the tech industry is non-diverse and maybe just a little bit too interested in ‘profit over people’. Who can blame such an opinion when government funded adverts like ‘Fatima’s next job could be in cyber’ are tactlessly emblazoned around the country?</p>

                            <p>But technology is exciting! There is vast potential for programming to contribute in a positive way to areas like education, environment and health which are currently struggling due to a lack of government funding. But more than this, its potential to improve the quality of peoples’ lives on both a local and global scale are endless.

                            <p>I have already mentioned Outlandish, but through this organisation, I was also introduced to CoTech - a network of cooperatives all operating with the same set of people centered values. The work carried out by its various members, such as trying to get more people involved in campaigning, is highly inspiring. The network represents an exciting new model of what the tech industry can be, and one which I am excited to be part of. </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>It is for this reason that I am so keen to continue my programming journey with Founders and Coders. The group’s peer-led, collaborative learning model, which places an emphasis on inclusion is highly appealing. I believe it offers me the unique chance to enter into an otherwise intimidating industry, in a way that will be both enjoyable and supportive.

                            <p>Being part of the FAC space on Discord over the past couple of months has been incredibly heartwarming. From being able to attend Zoom calls set up specifically for members of the LGBTQ community, to talking to previous humanities students (shocking) on the programme about katas has been fantastic. While I was initially overwhelmed by the prospect of sharing my response to coding challenges with a group of 80+ people, the friendly words of encouragement commonly found on the Discord channel have put all previous anxieties to rest. I would love to continue learning in this environment and to collaborate with such a positive and diverse group of people. </p>

                            <p>As a member of the LGBTQ community the fact that 92.6% of developers are straight/heterosexual is a less than appealing statistic. In fact, faced with the information that the tech industry offers such little diversity I have often veered in other directions. However, FACs commitment to inclusion (not just in name) but evident in the whole setup of their programme has made me optimistic that there are groups in the industry who are trying to tackle some of its diversity issues. I have felt comfortable in the spaces that FAC has so far presented and confident in amongst its community. </p>

                            <p>However, being a white university educated man, I am also aware of my own privileges and the need to constantly educate myself on issues of diversity, while also working actively to create safe spaces for minority groups. Having spent the last six months working at an incredibly diverse school in South London, I have been lucky enough to witness on a daily basis the fact that people are at their best when they are inclusive and tolerant of difference. I am therefore looking forward to the prospect of learning and working collaboratively with an upcoming cohort who share similar views. </p>

                            <p>Interested by the way human idiosyncrasies can be represented using visual and verbal narrative I studied English Literature at Edinburgh University. Throughout my studies I was an active participant in the world of publishing on the peripheries of student life - providing editorial work for a variety of magazines, papers and theatre groups. I am excited by starting my journey in the professional world of publishing and working for an organisation which will allow me to build on my current editorial skills.</p>

                            Hello, my name is Josh. I am a maker and creator from Glasgow, and I am applying to Founders and Coders because I hope it will equip me with skills I need to actualise my dream of becoming a professional software designer and engineer.

								<p>First things first - I love to make things. When I was a child I would spend hours on end building puppets and sets for stop-motion animations, convincing myself I was the next Tim Burton. Over the years this little penchant of mine has taken many forms, from book-binding to wood-turning, but throughout, one thing has remained unchanged: my passion for designing and creating.

								<p>I had a BIG realisation a few years ago that the most exciting things being made weren’t material objects like a stool or a lamp, but websites, and online platforms which responded to, and tackled a whole bunch of social issues.</p>

								<p>Organisations like Outlandish, who build web apps and data dashboards to make the world a ‘fairer, better place’ made me really excited about the possibilities of technology, and convinced me that if I was going to be a designer, a software designer I would be.</p>

								<p>Since graduating, working in education as a Learning Support Assistant, I have only become more convinced that computers and software are the key to solving a lot of social issues and making a positive contribution to society (yes, the kids paid more attention to the learning games on their computers than to my actual lessons). </p>

								<p>As such, I can’t wait to combine my design sensibilities with the technical skills I will learn on this programme to make digital products that will have a big impact in the world. I have already made a start in this direction, prototyping on <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/z9OhqhAromwQIlzNlg62r1/collectivisualdiary?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>, and in the last 4 months, learning to code. It has been an incredibly liberating journey so far, and one which I hope to continue with Founders and Coders.</p>

								<p class="text"> I have always been big softy for good storytelling! As I’ve already mentioned, I love animation, and used to make stop-motion films, cutting out elaborate paper cities for sets Edward Scissorhands couldn’t thathom. My favourite is probably Josep, although Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox has a special place in my heart (I used to love Roald Dahl… and still do). I am also a huge fan of graphic novels. I think they are a fantastic literary form, and in my spare time I sometimes write stories about tangerine monsters who take the place of King Kong in terrorising New York’s skyline, and my most ambitious piece to date, is about a man whose arms are too long to open his kitchen cupboard (riveting plots lines I know). I am a big outdoors person, and love to go rock-climbing, cycling or walking. I am incredibly excited about climbing walls being open again in London, and the possibility of learning to kayak on the West Reservoir when the sun finally decides to show up this summer. Rachael Roddy is my favourite chef, partly because 80% of her recipes contain pasta in one form or another. I would say I have an unhealthy love of pasta, but a healthy interest in making it for my friends. I also love to draw. My favourite artist is Georg Grosz, and while my work isn’t as good as his, you can check it out <a href="https://f65.cargo.site/">here</a>. </p></p>

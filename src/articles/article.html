How can you spread hummus on your bread without using a knife? How can you waterproof your phone while going for a swim? Or how can you peel a lemon using nothing but a toothpick? </br></br> Admittedly, I don’t know the answer to this last question, but the point is: I like thinking outside of the box. </br></br> I also love applying this type of logic to various roles I’ve had over the years. Working in a primary school, for example, I had to think creatively (on a daily basis) about how to get kids interested in subjects they wouldn’t normally touch with a barge pole. </br></br> I am looking forward to indulging in my creative side on the programme, being challenged by group members’ creativity, and helping others in this direction too."

I have been lucky enough over the past few years to work with a whole bunch of great people and groups on issues of sustainability, community and creative access. </br></br> I volunteered for the Edinburgh-based architecture collective Civic Soup on their ‘Wikihouse’ project, which aimed to create a space for young people in Fountainbridge to grow vegetables and hold activities. </br></br> I contributed to the construction of a small library for the Escuela Superior de Diseño in Madrid - a public participation project initiated by the architecture firm Recetas Urbanas. </br></br> While living in Amsterdam during my Erasmus year, I worked amongst other volunteers for Taste Before You Waste, an initiative focused on food waste prevention, by creating meals out of discarded produce. </br></br> So, in short, I hope to be able to bring to the cohort my enthusiasm for teamwork and my faith in its ability to create great social impact."
